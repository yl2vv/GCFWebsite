It says in Scripture to pray without ceasing,\n                      and not just for yourself, but also to pray for one\n                      another-- for leaders, for the unsaved, for the persecuted\n                      church, and for fellow believers. It's also just an\n                      amazing opportunity and privilege to commune with our\n                      heavenly Father. Prayer ministry is where we can practice\n                      praying on a deeper level, share requests, and pray in one\n                      voice and mind. We encourage you to join to enrich your\n                      own prayer life and to grow your heart for God's people\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"comment\">\n                      <a className=\"underliner\">Contact info:</a>\n                      Phil Choi (psc3yh), Kacie Park (kjp6ah)\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs wrap=\"nowrap\" spacing={2} className={classes.paper}>\n              <div className=\"paper\">\n                <div className=\"pic_container cam_pic\">Creative Arts (CAM)</div>\n\n                <div className=\"blackglass\">\n                  <div className=\"text\">Creative Arts Ministry</div>\n                  <div className=\"leaders\">\n                    Led by Jenny Chun & Katelynn Lee\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"snippet\">\n                    <div className=\"comment\">\n                      <a className=\"underliner\">What we do:</a> we aim to use\n                      the growing interest in visual arts, specifically graphic\n                      design and video, to help our fellowship grow in any way.\n                      Understanding that God uses all things for his glory, this\n                      ministry was created to utilize our passions, hobbies, and\n                      interests in a way that can make much of God.\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"comment\">\n                      <a className=\"underliner\">Vision:</a> Our goal is to give\n                      the exec team and other ministries more time to focus on\n                      their ministry, rather than spending that time making\n                      graphics and videos.
