                    What we do: we host events where UVA students can send in
                    any questions about God, faith, or Christianity. We receive
                    the questions and discuss them amongst ourselves in an
                    apartment, referring to the Bible as our source of truth,
                    and then go in teams to deliver a grilled cheese sandwich
                    and an answer to the student who asked the question.
                    <br />
                    Purpose / Vision: We are an outreach ministry that seeks to
                    spread Godâ€™s love and make His name known through sharing
                    food and having discussions with the greater UVA community!
                    <br />
                    When we meet: meeting tri-weekly on thursdays at 9:15PM -
                    12AM (can leave before that too)
                    <br />
                    Why someone should join: people should join to fulfill our
                    calling to spread His word and His love, and to have an
                    opportunity to have fruitful discussions and conversations
                    with GCF/Cru people and with the UVA community.
